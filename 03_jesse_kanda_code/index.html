            	<p class="main-txt">Common themes in Kanda's work have been growth, decay, death, freedom, fantasy, empathy, dream, innocence, subconscious, sexuality, sensuality, pain, suffering, euphoria, the body, movement, and magic.

Kanda often employs a unique balance of aesthetic beauty and the grotesque. Juxtaposing life and death; or love and fear. Although he is mostly known for his sculptural mixed media images, animations and music, he has also ventured into traditional filmmaking, sculpture, fashion, painting and photography.

His figures often exist in a dream-like spatial environment, often disfigured but with a sense of empathy and strength.

He has often used the music video as his artistic medium. Either creating the music himself, or collaborating with close friends.</p>
